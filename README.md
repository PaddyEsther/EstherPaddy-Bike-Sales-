- Now about this adventure bike sales project;This project involved analysing sales data to identify trends, customer preferences, and performance patterns across different bike models. The main goal is to gain insights into sales volume, identify high-demand periods, and understand customer buying behaviour to support data-driven marketing and inventory management strategies.
- Insight: The analysis identified specific models and seasonal trends that significantly drive sales, with peak demand observed during certain months and among particular customer segments, indicating opportunities for targeted promotions.
- Recommendation: Targeted marketing campaigns focused on high-demand models and peak sales seasons (like seasonal discount campaigns, limited time pre-order campaigns with a small discount or bonus, high-demand bike models package bundling with accessories for instance, helmets, bike racks or navigation devices) should be implemented to optimise sales performance and inventory management, while exploring opportunities to engage high-value customer segments with personalised offers. For low-selling models; discounts and clearance sales should be offered, bundling with high-demand models' accessories, model education and awareness campaigns, referral incentives for them can be offered too.
